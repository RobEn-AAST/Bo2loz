### Dev and collaboration notes:
 - write your name beside the feature you will work on and edit requirements according to what you will do.
 - always pull before you start working or before pushing.
 - document everything you do in the readme file or in comments in order to let everyone know what not to do.
 - follow naming, documenting and organizing convention as if they are the law, because the are.
 - **try to take a functional approach to avoid working on someone elses code, be abstract.**
